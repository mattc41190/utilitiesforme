        <p>Great question, <i>Utilities For Me</i> is what it sounds like... It's simple and fun utilities I find myself needing reasonably regularly and needing to go to sites that I neither know nor trust to get it done! I have written my own version and also made the source available so you can deploy it yourself if you are worried!</p>
